# Customer Success Engineering Roles

Our customer success engineering roles are defined by expectations for each level in terms of:

- **Planning horizon**: The typical timeframe to be thinking ahead about your impacts
- **Impact radius**: The number of people or teams typically impacted by your work
- **Evaluated by**: The person typically accountable for evaluating your performance
- **Responsibility and direction needed**: The expected degree of autonomy at that level

...and in each of the following dimensions:

- 🦉 Domain expertise
- 🌱 Teaching and Mentoring
- 🧭 Culture and Leadership
- 🏆 Customer Success

The following pages provide demonstrable values and concrete examples to describe these expectations:
